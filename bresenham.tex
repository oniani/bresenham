\section{Derivation}

Let the radius of the circle be given and equal \(r\). Any point \((x, y)\) on the circle satisfies
the following:
\begin{equation}
    x^2 + y^2 = r^2
\end{equation}

Consider the upper 45 degrees in the first quadrant of the circle. The next point could then be
placed either to the east \((x + 1, y)\) or southeast \((x + 1, y - 1)\). The errors for both
scenarios are:
\begin{align}
    &e(x + 1, y) = {(x + 1)}^2 + y^2 - r^2\\
    &e(x + 1, y - 1) = {(x + 1)}^2 + {(y - 1)}^2 - r^2
\end{align}

The decision parameter \(d\) is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
    d = e(x + 1, y) + e(x + 1, y - 1)
      = 2{(x + 1)}^2 + y^2 + {(y - 1)}^2 - 2r^2
\end{equation}

Since the \(x\) coordinate always increases, the next point is some \((x + 1, y_n)\) and we get:
\begin{equation}
    d_n = e(x + 2, y_n) + e(x + 2, y_n - 1)
        = 2{(x + 2)}^2 + {y_n}^2 + {(y_n - 1)}^2 - 2r^2
\end{equation}

The difference is equal to the following:
\begin{equation}
    d_n - d = 2(2x + 3) + \big({y_n}^2 - y^2\big) + \big({(y_n - 1)}^2 - {(y - 1)}^2\big)
\end{equation}

Finally, we have:
\begin{align}
    &d_n - d = 2(2x + 3) &&\implies d_n
             = d + 4x + 6 &&\text{ if } d \leq 0\ (y_n = y)\\
    &d_n - d = 2(2x + 3) - 4y + 4 &&\implies d_n
             = d + 4(x - y) + 10 &&\text{ if } d > 0\ (y_n = y - 1)\\
    &d_0 = 2{(0 + 1)}^2 + r^2 + {(r - 1)}^2 - 2r^2 &&\implies d_0
         = 3 - 2r &&\text{ at initial point } (0, r)
\end{align}
